# Coursera Data Science Specialization Course: Reproducible Resarch

# 
# Introduction
# 
# It is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal movement using
# activity monitoring devices such as a Fitbit, Nike Fuelband, or Jawbone Up. These type
# of devices are part of the "quantified self" movement - a group of enthusiasts who take
# measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in
# their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. But these data remain under-utilized both because the raw data
# are hard to obtain and there is a lack of statistical methods and software for processing
# and interpreting the data.
# 
# This assignment makes use of data from a personal activity monitoring device. This device
# collects data at 5 minute intervals through out the day. The data consists of two months
# of data from an anonymous individual collected during the months of October and November,
# 2012 and include the number of steps taken in 5 minute intervals each day.
# 
# The data for this assignment can be downloaded from the course web site:
# 
# The variables included in this dataset are:
# 
# * steps: Number of steps taking in a 5-minute interval (missing values are coded as NA)
# * date: The date on which the measurement was taken in YYYY-MM-DD format
# * interval: Identifier for the 5-minute interval in which measurement was taken
# 
# The dataset is stored in a comma-separated-value (CSV) file and there are a total of
# 17,568 observations in this dataset.
